<h2 id=objetivo>:scroll: Objective</h2>

This project was developed for evaluation in the disciplines:

- Programming Practices
- Database Modeling and Development

He was evaluated and received a total grade in both subjects. <br>

We developed two systems in the C # language.
We use Windows Forms for both applications and both connect to an SQL SERVER database.<br>

The first system is an APP for the UPA (Emergency Care Unit),
where patients needing care will be registered.<br>
The second system is an APP for the patient where he will consult which UPA has less people being served.<br>

The project aims to seek faster service for all people who need the UPA service.<br>
Consequently, the UPA will gain flexibility, because if it is full of people, it will not be overcrowded.

</p>

This is the application that should work in the UPA's.<br>
After the login of the UPA employee (doctor for example), we have access to the main screen where the functionalities exist:
- Patient care: registration of personal data and description of the health problem
- Complete care: after the patient is released from the UPA, we are able to leave the system
- Location for access to useful telephones in the health area
- Place to print a booklet for good practices against COVID-19

It has the main functionality to search the UPA regional office and obtain the stocking and address information.
